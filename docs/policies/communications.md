# üó£Ô∏è Communications

At Spark, we use Slack and Confluence for our communications.

## Slack

Slack has:

- Channels (#General, #Engineering, #Operations, #Marketing, etc.)
- Group messages
- Direct messages

## Confluence

Confluence has:

- Long-form entries
- Playbooks

### Here's how to know what to use:

- **Things that are only relevant for today:** Post in a Slack channel like #General or #Engineering.

  *Example:* "Hey, ESLint is breaking for me, can someone help?"

- **Things that are relevant for a week up to a month:** Use a thread in Slack (see below for etiquette).

  *Example:* RFCs, Bug Reports, Sales Notes, etc.

- **Things that are only relevant for one person:** Send a direct message in Slack.

  *Example:* "Hey, can you book my link for peer programming?"

- **Things that are relevant forever and for future hires:** Document in Confluence.

  *Example:* This entry.

### The "Slack Police"

One thing we've adopted company-wide is the "Slack Police" üöìüöìüöì. Essentially, when a conversation either goes off-topic or becomes too sync-heavy (i.e., too many people chiming in, too many different opinions, etc.), we move the discussion into an async thread. 

Threads are more structured, less noisy, async-friendly, and easier to follow up on at a later time.

Every team member is empowered to share the "Slack Police" emojis üöìüöìüöì when they feel like a conversation is getting out of hand in a group chat.

Anyone who continues discussing the topic in the sync chat afterwards goes to async-jail immediately ‚Äì do not pass Go, do not collect $200.

## Threads Best Practices

### Using Blocks

Using blocks allows others to reply to specific ideas and/or sections of a thread instead of a large piece of text. Simply hit "enter" to add more blocks.

The cool thing about Async Threads here is that you can reply on different thoughts throughout a longer time period.

Threads have introduced the concept of blocks which is indicated by the horizontal line.

Make use of them whenever you want to split different topics. It'll be easier for other people to follow your unique thought as.

**DO:** Split blocks per topic.

**DON'T:**

- Should we do A?
- Maybe B?
- Oh, did you hear about Rihanna?
- Britney Spears is doing what?

**TLDR:** Blocks cost nothing and help with structure.


# üìà High-Level Principles

## Always Self-Express in an Articulate Way

- Use a confident and clear voice to ensure everyone can hear.
- Avoid sarcasm. Be objective and constructive.
- Provide context to your messages. Background information can help others understand the topic or issue at hand.
- Personalize your communication. Always use a photo as an avatar to present yourself as a person, making communication more human.
- While emojis, animated gifs, or humor can help convey emotions, they should not replace clear and properly worded confirmations and affirmations.
- Expect most online communication to be asynchronous. Avoid repeated interruptions to allow team members to focus on their tasks. Plan in advance when needing feedback.

## Be Clear with Yourself

Clear communication starts with clarity of thought. Without a clear intent, your messages can become scattered and inefficient:

- Unclear messages make it hard for others to understand and respond effectively.
- Organized thoughts lead to clear and effective communication.

Before initiating communication, prepare your message and organize your thoughts.

## Choose the Right Medium

After clarifying and organizing your thoughts, select the appropriate medium for communication based on the topic, audience, and urgency.

### Asynchronous Communication

Email is preferred for asynchronous communication. Unless the message is urgent and requires an immediate response, communicate asynchronously. This allows recipients to contemplate the message and prepare their response, respecting their focus and timing.

#### Email Guidelines

Slack can also be used for asynchronous communication, though email is preferred for less urgent matters. Instant messaging tools always carry a sense of urgency, even when the message is not urgent.

### Synchronous Communication

Instant messaging (specifically Slack) is preferred for synchronous communication when a question or problem is urgent and requires an immediate answer.

Critical thinking is essential to determine urgency. Communication should be considered urgent if it blocks progress or involves a risk that needs to be addressed immediately.

#### Instant Messaging

IM is the preferred medium as it provides flexibility to recipients, allowing them to finish their current task and prepare a response. If a conversation in IM exceeds a dozen messages without resolution, consider scheduling a meeting.

#### Meetings

Meetings can be highly effective or a waste of time. When a meeting is necessary, ensure you are clear about the topic to communicate effectively.

## Respect Others‚Äô Time

When reaching out, ensure you have thoroughly considered the topic and selected an appropriate time. Expecting an immediate and well-formed response is unrealistic and disrespectful.

### Thought Gathering

People need time to gather their thoughts on the topic. Unless they know the answer immediately, they will need time to think clearly before responding.

### Deep Work

At Spark, tasks like software development require deep focus sessions where individuals are completely absorbed in their work. Interruptions can significantly disrupt focus and waste hours of productivity.

### Prepare Early

Communicate with colleagues and partners early. Do not wait until the last minute to request help, as it shows a lack of proactivity and can waste others‚Äô time.

### Keep Communication Centralized

To ensure transparency and efficiency, keep communication centralized using Slack channels. Public channels keep everyone involved and allow others to contribute, even if they were not initially part of the conversation. This approach also leaves a record of what was discussed and agreed upon.

#### Avoid 1-on-1 Chats

Most conversations should be conducted on public channels for transparency. Exceptions should be rare, especially for project-related topics.

If someone initiates a 1-on-1 conversation, remind them of the importance of transparency and keeping chats on public channels. Use this template:
:::warning[Template]
*Thanks for reaching out about this. Before I answer, let‚Äôs move this conversation to a public channel. It is important to keep the whole team in the loop, and others might also contribute to this conversation. You can find more about our 1-on-1 chats policy in our handbook: http://spark.link/1-on-1-chats.*
:::
Then, copy and paste the message to a public channel, tag the original sender, and add your answer or comment.
