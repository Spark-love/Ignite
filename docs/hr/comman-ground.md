# ðŸ’¡ Common Ground

At Spark, we believe that a strong work ethic forms the foundation of our success. This means showing up on time, being reliable, doing what you say you'll do, and maintaining trustworthiness. It involves putting in an honest day's work, respecting our colleagues, and the organization, and ensuring that we do not create unnecessary work for others. Being someone who others can rely on and enjoy working with is at the heart of our work culture.

## Core Hours

Our standard work hours are from 9:00 to 18:00, Monday to Saturday, excluding a lunch break. To accommodate personal schedules, we offer flexible start times from 8:00 to 10:00. However, all team members must be available and working by 10:00 at the latest, whether at the office or remotely.

In our industry, being available during client hours is essential. Hence, 
:::tip[Core Hours]
we have established core hours from 10:00 to 17:00 (Bangkok time, GMT+7) to ensure that we are all present and can collaborate effectively during this period.
:::
If you start your day later than 9:00, you are expected to adjust your end time to meet your daily work commitment. Similarly, if you start earlier, you may finish earlier.

## Trust & Fairness

We trust each team member to deliver the expected workload and maintain productivity. Adhering to these principles helps avoid conflicts and ensures a smooth workflow.

Everyone is expected to contribute their fair share. If one person falls short, it burdens the rest of the team. Delivering timely responses and solutions to our clients is crucial to maintaining satisfaction and trust.

Working with integrity and fairness, whether in the office or remotely, is vital for the wellbeing of our team and the company.

## Etiquette

Respect for colleagues is paramount. Maintain professionalism in all interactions, whether in person or online. For example, always use your webcam during online meetings and ensure you are in a quiet environment.

<!-- ## Food

The company provides snacks and drinks for everyone. These are restocked twice a month. Feel free to bring your own food and consume it on the premises whenever you like. Team events are occasionally organized, but there is no requirement to have lunch together.

Alcoholic beverages are permitted in the office only during specific team events. -->

<!-- ## Noise

Given that we only work from the office two days a week, itâ€™s understandable that team members will want to catch up in person. However, excessive noise can be distracting. Keep conversations at a reasonable volume and use headphones for music. -->

## Assets

Teammates based in Thailand or India can request company equipment, such as laptops, mice, and keyboards. We also support Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) with a BYOD allowance.

## Centralized Communication

To maintain transparency and efficiency, all communications should be centralized using Slack channels. Public channels ensure that everyone stays informed and can contribute to the conversation. This practice helps create a comprehensive record of discussions and decisions.

Avoid private 1-on-1 conversations unless absolutely necessary. If someone initiates a private chat, remind them of the importance of public channels and move the conversation accordingly:

*Thanks for reaching out. Let's move this conversation to a public channel so the whole team can stay in the loop and others might also contribute. You can find more about our communication policy in our handbook: [link to handbook].*

Then, continue the discussion in the relevant public channel.
