# 👷 Contract-to-hire Trials

At Spark, we approach hiring differently. Most of our full-time employees start with a 30-day contract-to-hire trial period. This trial involves a 30-day contract with Spark, after which we make a final decision on whether to offer a full-time position.

Understandably, candidates often ask what “success” looks like during this trial. The focus of the trial is less on “proving why you should join” and more on “identifying any reasons why you shouldn’t join.”

If we offer you a trial, it’s because we see potential in you joining our team. The trial period is designed for both you and us to uncover any red flags **while** working together.

Don’t feel pressured to be perfect during the trial. Think of it like dating: be yourself, be authentic, be real.

The trial is as much for you as it is for us. It’s your opportunity to work without long-term commitment. Your task is to assess:

Do I like …

* the mission?
* the codebase?
* my team members?
* working with the founders?
* the market?
* building in public?
* working asynchronously?
* using Slack and other tools?
* the flexibility of working remotely?

For us, it’s a chance to get to know you better before offering a permanent position. Why? Because it’s not ideal for anyone if you leave your current job, commit to a long-term contract with us, and then we both realize it’s not a good fit.

The worst outcome: you take a significant risk without any reward.

We dislike letting people go. Every company does. Ending a LeanHire trial feels less severe because it’s not a full commitment yet.

Like dating, it’s okay to part ways after a short period if it’s not working out.

**TL;DR:**

* A LeanHire trial doesn’t have a strict “success” goal.
* It’s a way for you to get an inside look at Spark quickly.
* Ending a trial should feel less harsh than firing (though it’s still not pleasant 😞).
